Whats Cooking

Using RNN to Predict the Cuisine given the ingredients of a dish

Steps we took:
1. Formattin the data into matrices
2. Augmenting the data (adding more data with different permutations of the ingredients
3. Train the model using RNN on multiple data points in the training data set
4. Test model by predicting on sample training data
